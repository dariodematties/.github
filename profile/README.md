# [Waggle AI@Edge](https://github.com/orgs/waggle-sensor/repositories)

Waggle is a state-of-the-art open-source platform for developing and deploying novel artificial intelligence algorithms and new sensors into distributed sensor networks.  By providing  advanced edge computing capabilities, researchers and practitioners using Waggle can analyze high-resolution instrument data at unprecedented speeds, providing new insights and answering scientific questions not previously possible.

The Waggle Platform is a research project at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) and its innovative architecture leverages emerging technology in low-power processors, sensors, and cloud computing to build powerful and reliable sensor nodes that can actively analyze and respond to data. Cloud computing provides elastic resources for storing and computing on data.

Waggle is designed from the ground up with security, privacy, extensability, and survivability as key design points. The Waggle reference platforms and software are launching points. All of the software is Open Source, and the software is modular, so researchers can add their own sensors, computing pipelines, and data analysis.

The name for the project comes from nature’s wireless sensors — honeybees. Bees search far and wide for pollen, and report their findings back to the hive using a sophisticated dance called a “waggle dance“. The dance encodes the distance and angle to the food source, and is often similar to a figure-8 — which is why we picked [wa8.gl](http://wa8.gl/) as our domain name.
